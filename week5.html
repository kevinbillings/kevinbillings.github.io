    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
    <p>This week covers Ch10: Testing and Debugging</p>
    <p>Thank you Bro. Thayne for the detailed overview and explanation of our project during the All-Hands this week.</p>
    <h2>Debugging</h2>
    <p>The console has some really neat built-in functionality for debugging.<br/>
    &emsp; debugger();<br/><br/>
    <p>Simply entering debugger(); into the code will set break points to check what is currently going on in the code.<br/>
    <h2>Error Objects</h2>
    <p>Yup, you read that right.  We can create error objects for certain exceptions in the code.</p>
    <p>const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');</p>
    <p>Try - Catch - Finally</p>
    <p>function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {<br/>
    &emsp;'use strict';<br/>
    &emsp;let answer;<br/>
    &emsp;try {<br/>
    &emsp;&emsp;answer = String(squareRoot(number));<br/>
    &emsp;} catch(error) {<br/>
    &emsp;answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";<br/>
    &emsp;} finally {<br/>
    &emsp;&emsp;return `+ or - ${answer}`;<br/>
    &emsp;}<br/>
    }
