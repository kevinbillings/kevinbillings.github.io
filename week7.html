    <h1>Week 7 - Half Way There!!!</h1>
    <p>This week covered Ch 11: Further Functions, and Ch 13: AJAX.</p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>Functions are first-class objects.  They have a length property that will tell the number of parameters they have.  I.E. "addStudent.length"</p>
    <p>The "call()" method can be used to set the value of 'this'</p>
    <p>There are temporary variables called temp.</p>
    <p>Functions can define and rewrite themselves?!</p>
    <p>function party(){</p>
    &emsp;console.log('Wow this is amazing!');<br/>
    &emsp;party = function () {<br/>
    &emsp;&emsp;console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');<br/>
    &emsp;}<br/>
    }<br/>
    <p>Recursive functions call themselves until a set condition is met.</p>
    <p>You can return a function from a function in JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>AJAX and not the stuff you clean the bathroom with.</h2>
    <p>The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers. A client, such as a web browser, will request
       a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client.  JavaScript was originally 
       designed as a client-side scripting language, meaning that it ran locally in the browser, adding dynamic features to the web page that was returned 
       from the server. Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data 
       or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.</p>
    <p>AJAX will allow multiple pieces of the software to run at the same time without waiting for each serial piece to complete.  It is Asynchronous.</p>
    <h2>The Fetch API is how to send Asynchronous data accross a network.</h2>
    <p>Firebase is a neat method to store data online.  Juggling between local and network storage you can keep track of data in an app and upload the next 
       time you are connected to the network.</p>
